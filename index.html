                <h2>Hello</h2>

                <p>The Diptipur Children’s Hostel (DCH) is a small hostel, which aims to provide a secure environment for the holistic support of children, both boys and girls. </p>

                <p>The Hostel provides accommodation for the children from villages in the district of Odisha India. This allows them to continue their education, which would be curtailed if this provision were not available. Children spend term time in the hostel, returning home during holidays. </p>

                <p>The hostel provides for the children in many ways including:</p>

                <ul>
                <li>A safe, healthy, clean environment with the support of a caring staff.</li>
                <li>A supportive place where their schooling is strengthened through use of a study area, and library.</li>
                <li>A holistic approach to their development including opportunities to contribute to the communities in which they live, through various development projects.</li>
                <li>Spiritual encouragement, through prayer times, regular bible devotions and Christian services (Sunday School).</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Education creates opportunities. Children who go to school have a better chance of getting a job, are more aware of health risks and can make meaningful decisions about their own lives based on a better understanding of the world in which they live. The DCH gives children the chance to gain that vital education. When you sponsor a child your money goes to the running of the hostel, to school fees and the basic needs of the children.</p>

                <h2>How to sponsor a child</h2>

                <p>When you sponsor a child you begin to change their life. They are lifted out of the cycle of poverty and helplessness in which they are trapped. The child you support will be able to access education and other basic needs in a residential child care home.</p>

                <p>For £120 a year you can change a life. That is just £10 per month, £2.30 weekly or 33p a day.</p>

                <h3>How will your money be used?</h3>

                <aside>
                    <h3>Chickens</h3>
                    <p>&ldquo;We want to help support ourselves, so we are learning  to rear poultry, which we can sell in the local markets.&rdquo;</p>
                </aside>

                <p>All your money goes to the support of the child in the Hostel. You will provide accommodation during term time, food, toiletries, a school uniform, school fees, and all the support needed to run the hostel. 
                We use a small percentage (5%) to cover our expenses. Unlike many 'sponsor a child schemes,' where your money goes to the community where the child lives, our scheme aims solely to make it possible for the sponsored child to receive the education they need to create a better life for themselves.  </p>

                <p>When you first sign up to sponsor, you’ll receive a welcome pack with a photo of your sponsored child and information about them and their community. This will be followed by a letter or drawing from your sponsored child. You’ll receive an annual update and photograph, so that you can follow your sponsored child's progress. You will also be able to send personal messages and pictures, which  are greatly valued by sponsored children and can really help to build strong relationships.</p>

                <p>All you have to do now is to fill in the Sponsorship form, which includes a direct debit mandate to your bank and we will do the rest, it couldn't be easier. We will then send you a welcome pack which will introduce you to your sponsored child and their community. We ask you to commit for at least 3years, this will bring some stability to the children in the hostel. However we realise that situations change and you can if you wish stop your support at any time. We do ask that you give us at least a months notice if possible!</p>
